             <h1>WHY NATURE NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED</h1>
             <p className="about-para">The most obvious reason for conservation is to protect wildlife and promote biodiversity. Protecting wildlife and preserving it for future generations also means that the animals we love don’t become a distant memory. And we can maintain a healthy and functional ecosystem. It’s no secret that the future of our planet desperately needs to be safeguarded, with climate change already wreaking havoc on our natural environment. In order to preserve the earth for future generations, we not only need to reduce the amount of harm that human activities have on the environment but support the natural world as much as we can.One pretty big reason for conservation work that is talked about a little less often is the impact that it has on human health. Both in terms of preventing the emergence of new diseases, and the production of medicines that we rely upon.</p>
